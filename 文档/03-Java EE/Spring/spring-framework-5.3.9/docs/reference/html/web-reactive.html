<h2 id="webflux"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux"></a>1. Spring WebFlux</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original web framework included in the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC, was
purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers. The reactive-stack web framework,
Spring WebFlux, was added later in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports
<a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> back pressure, and runs on such servers as
Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules
(<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-webmvc">spring-webmvc</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-webflux">spring-webflux</a>) and co-exist side by side in the
Spring Framework. Each module is optional. Applications can use one or the other module or,
in some cases, both&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, Spring MVC controllers with the reactive <code>WebClient</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="webflux-new-framework"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-new-framework"></a>1.1. Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why was Spring WebFlux created?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of the answer is the need for a non-blocking web stack to handle concurrency with a
small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware resources. Servlet 3.1 did provide
an API for non-blocking I/O. However, using it leads away from the rest of the Servlet API,
where contracts are synchronous (<code>Filter</code>, <code>Servlet</code>) or blocking (<code>getParameter</code>,
<code>getPart</code>). This was the motivation for a new common API to serve as a foundation across
any non-blocking runtime. That is important because of servers (such as Netty) that are
well-established in the async, non-blocking space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other part of the answer is functional programming. Much as the addition of annotations
in Java 5 created opportunities (such as annotated REST controllers or unit tests), the addition
of lambda expressions in Java 8 created opportunities for functional APIs in Java.
This is a boon for non-blocking applications and continuation-style APIs (as popularized
by <code>CompletableFuture</code> and <a href="http://reactivex.io/">ReactiveX</a>) that allow declarative
composition of asynchronous logic. At the programming-model level, Java 8 enabled Spring
WebFlux to offer functional web endpoints alongside annotated controllers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="webflux-why-reactive"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-why-reactive"></a>1.1.1. Define &#8220;Reactive&#8221;</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We touched on &#8220;non-blocking&#8221; and &#8220;functional&#8221; but what does reactive mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term, &#8220;reactive,&#8221; refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;network components reacting to I/O events, UI controllers reacting to mouse events, and others.
In that sense, non-blocking is reactive, because, instead of being blocked, we are now in the mode
of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also another important mechanism that we on the Spring team associate with &#8220;reactive&#8221;
and that is non-blocking back pressure. In synchronous, imperative code, blocking calls
serve as a natural form of back pressure that forces the caller to wait. In non-blocking
code, it becomes important to control the rate of events so that a fast producer does not
overwhelm its destination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reactive Streams is a
<a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/master/README.md#specification">small spec</a>
(also <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html">adopted</a> in Java 9)
that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure.
For example a data repository (acting as
<a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/Publisher.html">Publisher</a>)
can produce data that an HTTP server (acting as
<a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/Subscriber.html">Subscriber</a>)
can then write to the response. The main purpose of Reactive Streams is to let the
  subscriber control how quickly or how slowly the publisher produces data.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="webflux-reactive-api"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-reactive-api"></a>1.1.2. Reactive API</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability. It is of interest to libraries
and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API, because it is too
low-level. Applications need a higher-level and richer, functional API to
compose async logic&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;similar to the Java 8 <code>Stream</code> API but not only for collections.
This is the role that reactive libraries play.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor">Reactor</a> is the reactive library of choice for
Spring WebFlux. It provides the
<a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html"><code>Mono</code></a> and
<a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html"><code>Flux</code></a> API types
to work on data sequences of 0..1 (<code>Mono</code>) and 0..N (<code>Flux</code>) through a rich set of operators aligned with the
ReactiveX <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html">vocabulary of operators</a>.
Reactor is a Reactive Streams library and, therefore, all of its operators support non-blocking back pressure.
Reactor has a strong focus on server-side Java. It is developed in close collaboration
with Spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WebFlux requires Reactor as a core dependency but it is interoperable with other reactive
libraries via Reactive Streams. As a general rule, a WebFlux API accepts a plain <code>Publisher</code>
as input, adapts it to a Reactor type internally, uses that, and returns either a
<code>Flux</code> or a <code>Mono</code> as output. So, you can pass any <code>Publisher</code> as input and you can apply
operations on the output, but you need to adapt the output for use with another reactive library.
Whenever feasible (for example, annotated controllers), WebFlux adapts transparently to the use
of RxJava or another reactive library. See <a href="#webflux-reactive-libraries">Reactive Libraries</a> for more details.</p>

<h4 id="webflux-programming-models"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-programming-models"></a>1.1.3. Programming Models</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>spring-web</code> module contains the reactive foundation that underlies Spring WebFlux,
including HTTP abstractions, Reactive Streams <a href="#webflux-httphandler">adapters</a> for supported
servers, <a href="#webflux-codecs">codecs</a>, and a core <a href="#webflux-web-handler-api"><code>WebHandler</code> API</a> comparable to
the Servlet API but with non-blocking contracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On that foundation, Spring WebFlux provides a choice of two programming models:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#webflux-controller">Annotated Controllers</a>: Consistent with Spring MVC and based on the same annotations
from the <code>spring-web</code> module. Both Spring MVC and WebFlux controllers support reactive
(Reactor and RxJava) return types, and, as a result, it is not easy to tell them apart. One notable
difference is that WebFlux also supports reactive <code>@RequestBody</code> arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#webflux-fn">Functional Endpoints</a>: Lambda-based, lightweight, and functional programming model. You can think of
this as a small library or a set of utilities that an application can use to route and
handle requests. The big difference with annotated controllers is that the application
is in charge of request handling from start to finish versus declaring intent through
annotations and being called back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="webflux-framework-choice"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-framework-choice"></a>1.1.4. Applicability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring MVC or WebFlux?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A natural question to ask but one that sets up an unsound dichotomy. Actually, both
work together to expand the range of available options. The two are designed for
continuity and consistency with each other, they are available side by side, and feedback
from each side benefits both sides. The following diagram shows how the two relate, what they
have in common, and what each supports uniquely:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/spring-mvc-and-webflux-venn.png" alt="spring mvc and webflux venn">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We suggest that you consider the following specific points:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have a Spring MVC application that works fine, there is no need to change.
Imperative programming is the easiest way to write, understand, and debug code.
You have maximum choice of libraries, since, historically, most are blocking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are already shopping for a non-blocking web stack, Spring WebFlux offers the same
execution model benefits as others in this space and also provides a choice of servers
(Netty, Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers), a choice of programming models
(annotated controllers and functional web endpoints), and a choice of reactive libraries
(Reactor, RxJava, or other).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are interested in a lightweight, functional web framework for use with Java 8 lambdas
or Kotlin, you can use the Spring WebFlux functional web endpoints. That can also be a good choice
for smaller applications or microservices with less complex requirements that can benefit
from greater transparency and control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a microservice architecture, you can have a mix of applications with either Spring MVC
or Spring WebFlux controllers or with Spring WebFlux functional endpoints. Having support
for the same annotation-based programming model in both frameworks makes it easier to
re-use knowledge while also selecting the right tool for the right job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A simple way to evaluate an application is to check its dependencies. If you have blocking
persistence APIs (JPA, JDBC) or networking APIs to use, Spring MVC is the best choice
for common architectures at least. It is technically feasible with both Reactor and
RxJava to perform blocking calls on a separate thread but you would not be making the
most of a non-blocking web stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a Spring MVC application with calls to remote services, try the reactive <code>WebClient</code>.
You can return reactive types (Reactor, RxJava, <a href="#webflux-reactive-libraries">or other</a>)
directly from Spring MVC controller methods. The greater the latency per call or the
interdependency among calls, the more dramatic the benefits. Spring MVC controllers
can call other reactive components too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a large team, keep in mind the steep learning curve in the shift to non-blocking,
functional, and declarative programming. A practical way to start without a full switch
is to use the reactive <code>WebClient</code>. Beyond that, start small and measure the benefits.
We expect that, for a wide range of applications, the shift is unnecessary. If you are
unsure what benefits to look for, start by learning about how non-blocking I/O works
(for example, concurrency on single-threaded Node.js) and its effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="webflux-server-choice"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-server-choice"></a>1.1.5. Servers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux is supported on Tomcat, Jetty, Servlet 3.1+ containers, as well as on
non-Servlet runtimes such as Netty and Undertow. All servers are adapted to a low-level,
<a href="#webflux-httphandler">common API</a> so that higher-level
<a href="#webflux-programming-models">programming models</a> can be supported across servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux does not have built-in support to start or stop a server. However, it is
easy to <a href="#webflux-web-handler-api">assemble</a> an application from Spring configuration and
<a href="#webflux-config">WebFlux infrastructure</a> and <a href="#webflux-httphandler">run it</a> with a few
lines of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring Boot has a WebFlux starter that automates these steps. By default, the starter uses
Netty, but it is easy to switch to Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow by changing your
Maven or Gradle dependencies. Spring Boot defaults to Netty, because it is more widely
used in the asynchronous, non-blocking space and lets a client and a server share resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tomcat and Jetty can be used with both Spring MVC and WebFlux. Keep in mind, however, that
the way they are used is very different. Spring MVC relies on Servlet blocking I/O and
lets applications use the Servlet API directly if they need to. Spring WebFlux
relies on Servlet 3.1 non-blocking I/O and uses the Servlet API behind a low-level
adapter. It is not exposed for direct use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Undertow, Spring WebFlux uses Undertow APIs directly without the Servlet API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="webflux-performance"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-performance"></a>1.1.6. Performance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance has many characteristics and meanings. Reactive and non-blocking generally
do not make applications run faster. They can, in some cases, (for example, if using the
<code>WebClient</code> to run remote calls in parallel). On the whole, it requires more work to do
things the non-blocking way and that can slightly increase the required processing time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key expected benefit of reactive and non-blocking is the ability to scale with a small,
fixed number of threads and less memory. That makes applications more resilient under load,
because they scale in a more predictable way. In order to observe those benefits, however, you
need to have some latency (including a mix of slow and unpredictable network I/O).
That is where the reactive stack begins to show its strengths, and the differences can be
dramatic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="webflux-concurrency-model"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-concurrency-model"></a>1.1.7. Concurrency Model</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux support annotated controllers, but there is a key
difference in the concurrency model and the default assumptions for blocking and threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Spring MVC (and servlet applications in general), it is assumed that applications can
block the current thread, (for example, for remote calls). For this reason, servlet containers
use a large thread pool to absorb potential blocking during request handling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Spring WebFlux (and non-blocking servers in general), it is assumed that applications
do not block. Therefore, non-blocking servers use  a small, fixed-size thread pool
(event loop workers) to handle requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
&#8220;To scale&#8221; and &#8220;small number of threads&#8221; may sound contradictory but to never block the
current thread (and rely on callbacks instead) means that you do not need extra threads, as
there are no blocking calls to absorb.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Invoking a Blocking API</div>
<p>What if you do need to use a blocking library? Both Reactor and RxJava provide the
<code>publishOn</code> operator to continue processing on a different thread. That means there is an
easy escape hatch. Keep in mind, however, that blocking APIs are not a good fit for
this concurrency model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Mutable State</div>
<p>In Reactor and RxJava, you declare logic through operators. At runtime, a reactive
pipeline is formed where data is processed sequentially, in distinct stages. A key benefit
of this is that it frees applications from having to protect mutable state because
application code within that pipeline is never invoked concurrently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Threading Model</div>
<p>What threads should you expect to see on a server running with Spring WebFlux?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On a &#8220;vanilla&#8221; Spring WebFlux server (for example, no data access nor other optional
dependencies), you can expect one thread for the server and several others for request
processing (typically as many as the number of CPU cores). Servlet containers, however,
may start with more threads (for example, 10 on Tomcat), in support of both servlet (blocking) I/O
and servlet 3.1 (non-blocking) I/O usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reactive <code>WebClient</code> operates in event loop style. So you can see a small, fixed
number of processing threads related to that (for example, <code>reactor-http-nio-</code> with the Reactor
Netty connector). However, if Reactor Netty is used for both client and server, the two
share event loop resources by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactor and RxJava provide thread pool abstractions, called schedulers, to use with the
<code>publishOn</code> operator that is used to switch processing to a different thread pool.
The schedulers have names that suggest a specific concurrency strategy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, &#8220;parallel&#8221;
(for CPU-bound work with a limited number of threads) or &#8220;elastic&#8221; (for I/O-bound work with
a large number of threads). If you see such threads, it means some code is using a
specific thread pool <code>Scheduler</code> strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data access libraries and other third party dependencies can also create and use threads
of their own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Configuring</div>
<p>The Spring Framework does not provide support for starting and stopping
<a href="#webflux-server-choice">servers</a>. To configure the threading model for a server,
you need to use server-specific configuration APIs, or, if you use Spring Boot,
check the Spring Boot configuration options for each server. You can

By default, this is the <code>DefaultPartHttpMessageReader</code>, which does not have any third-party

Alternatively, the <code>SynchronossPartHttpMessageReader</code> can be used, which is based on the

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239">RFC 7239</a> defines the <code>Forwarded</code> HTTP header
that proxies can use to provide information about the original request. There are other

<code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Ssl</code>, and <code>X-Forwarded-Prefix</code>.</p>

<p><code>ForwardedHeaderTransformer</code> is a component that modifies the host, port, and scheme of

it as a bean with the name <code>forwardedHeaderTransformer</code>, it will be
<a href="#webflux-web-handler-api-special-beans">detected</a> and used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are security considerations for forwarded headers, since an application cannot know
if the headers were added by a proxy, as intended, or by a malicious client. This is why
a proxy at the boundary of trust should be configured to remove untrusted forwarded traffic coming
from the outside. You can also configure the <code>ForwardedHeaderTransformer</code> with
<code>removeOnly=true</code>, in which case it removes but does not use the headers.</p>

<p>The <code>spring-core</code> module provides <code>byte[]</code>, <code>ByteBuffer</code>, <code>DataBuffer</code>, <code>Resource</code>, and

JSON, Jackson Smile, JAXB2, Protocol Buffers and other encoders and decoders along with
web-only HTTP message reader and writer implementations for form data, multipart content,
server-sent events, and others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>ClientCodecConfigurer</code> and <code>ServerCodecConfigurer</code> are typically used to configure and

<p>The <code>Jackson2Decoder</code> works as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jackson&#8217;s asynchronous, non-blocking parser is used to aggregate a stream of byte chunks
into <code>TokenBuffer</code>'s each representing a JSON object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each <code>TokenBuffer</code> is passed to Jackson&#8217;s <code>ObjectMapper</code> to create a higher level object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When decoding to a single-value publisher (e.g. <code>Mono</code>), there is one <code>TokenBuffer</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When decoding to a multi-value publisher (e.g. <code>Flux</code>), each <code>TokenBuffer</code> is passed to
the <code>ObjectMapper</code> as soon as enough bytes are received for a fully formed object. The
input content can be a JSON array, or any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming">line-delimited JSON</a> format such as NDJSON,
JSON Lines, or JSON Text Sequences.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Jackson2Encoder</code> works as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a single value publisher (e.g. <code>Mono</code>), simply serialize it through the
<code>ObjectMapper</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a multi-value publisher with <code>application/json</code>, by default collect the values with
<code>Flux#collectToList()</code> and then serialize the resulting collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a multi-value publisher with a streaming media type such as
<code>application/x-ndjson</code> or <code>application/stream+x-jackson-smile</code>, encode, write, and
flush each value individually using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming">line-delimited JSON</a> format. Other
streaming media types may be registered with the encoder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For SSE the <code>Jackson2Encoder</code> is invoked per event and the output is flushed to ensure

<p>On the server side where form content often needs to be accessed from multiple places,

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once <code>getFormData()</code> is used, the original raw content can no longer be read from the

another <code>HttpMessageReader</code> for the actual parsing to a <code>Flux&lt;Part&gt;</code> and then simply
collects the parts into a <code>MultiValueMap</code>.
By default, the <code>DefaultPartHttpMessageReader</code> is used, but this can be changed through the

For more information about the <code>DefaultPartHttpMessageReader</code>, refer to to the

<h5 id="webflux-codecs-limits"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-codecs-limits"></a>Limits</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Decoder</code> and <code>HttpMessageReader</code> implementations that buffer some or all of the input
stream can be configured with a limit on the maximum number of bytes to buffer in memory.
In some cases buffering occurs because input is aggregated and represented as a single
object — for example, a controller method with <code>@RequestBody byte[]</code>,
<code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> data, and so on. Buffering can also occur with streaming, when
splitting the input stream — for example, delimited text, a stream of JSON objects, and
so on. For those streaming cases, the limit applies to the number of bytes associated
with one object in the stream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To configure buffer sizes, you can check if a given <code>Decoder</code> or <code>HttpMessageReader</code>
exposes a <code>maxInMemorySize</code> property and if so the Javadoc will have details about default
values. On the server side, <code>ServerCodecConfigurer</code> provides a single place from where to
set all codecs, see <a href="#webflux-config-message-codecs">HTTP message codecs</a>. On the client side, the limit for
all codecs can be changed in
<a href="#webflux-client-builder-maxinmemorysize">WebClient.Builder</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For <a href="#webflux-codecs-multipart">Multipart parsing</a> the <code>maxInMemorySize</code> property limits
the size of non-file parts. For file parts, it determines the threshold at which the part
is written to disk. For file parts written to disk, there is an additional
<code>maxDiskUsagePerPart</code> property to limit the amount of disk space per part. There is also
a <code>maxParts</code> property to limit the overall number of parts in a multipart request.
To configure all three in WebFlux, you&#8217;ll need to supply a pre-configured instance of
<code>MultipartHttpMessageReader</code> to <code>ServerCodecConfigurer</code>.</p>

this reference has more on that in the section on
<a href="core.html#databuffers">Data Buffers and Codecs</a>. The key point to understand is that on some
servers like Netty, byte buffers are pooled and reference counted, and must be released
when consumed to avoid memory leaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WebFlux applications generally do not need to be concerned with such issues, unless they
consume or produce data buffers directly, as opposed to relying on codecs to convert to

<p>Spring WebFlux, similarly to Spring MVC, is designed around the front controller pattern,

request processing, while actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components.
This model is flexible and supports diverse workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>DispatcherHandler</code> discovers the delegate components it needs from Spring configuration.
It is also designed to be a Spring bean itself and implements <code>ApplicationContextAware</code>

<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.9/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/server/adapter/WebHttpHandlerBuilder.html"><code>WebHttpHandlerBuilder</code></a>,

<div class="paragraph">
<p>View resolution enables rendering to a browser with an HTML template and a model without
tying you to a specific view technology. In Spring WebFlux, view resolution is
supported through a dedicated <a href="#webflux-resulthandling">HandlerResultHandler</a> that uses
  <code>ViewResolver</code> instances to map a String (representing a logical view name) to a <code>View</code>
instance. The <code>View</code> is then used to render the response.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>HandlerResult</code> passed into <code>ViewResolutionResultHandler</code> contains the return value
from the handler and the model that contains attributes added during request
handling. The return value is processed as one of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>String</code>, <code>CharSequence</code>: A logical view name to be resolved to a <code>View</code> through
the list of configured <code>ViewResolver</code> implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>void</code>: Select a default view name based on the request path, minus the leading and
trailing slash, and resolve it to a <code>View</code>. The same also happens when a view name
was not provided (for example, model attribute was returned) or an async return value
(for example, <code>Mono</code> completed empty).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model</code>, <code>Map</code>: Extra model attributes to be added to the model for the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other: Any other return value (except for simple types, as determined by
<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.9/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-">BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty</a>)
is treated as a model attribute to be added to the model. The attribute name is derived
from the class name by using <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.9/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Conventions.html">conventions</a>,
unless a handler method <code>@ModelAttribute</code> annotation is present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model can contain asynchronous, reactive types (for example, from Reactor or RxJava). Prior
to rendering, <code>AbstractView</code> resolves such model attributes into concrete values
and updates the model. Single-value reactive types are resolved to a single
value or no value (if empty), while multi-value reactive types (for example, <code>Flux&lt;T&gt;</code>) are
collected and resolved to <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To configure view resolution is as simple as adding a <code>ViewResolutionResultHandler</code> bean
to your Spring configuration. <a href="#webflux-config-view-resolvers">WebFlux Config</a> provides a
dedicated configuration API for view resolution.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special <code>redirect:</code> prefix in a view name lets you perform a redirect. The
<code>UrlBasedViewResolver</code> (and sub-classes) recognize this as an instruction that a

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The net effect is the same as if the controller had returned a <code>RedirectView</code> or
<code>Rendering.redirectTo("abc").build()</code>, but now the controller itself can
operate in terms of logical view names. A view name such as
<code>redirect:/some/resource</code> is relative to the current application, while a view name such as
<code>redirect:https://example.com/arbitrary/path</code> redirects to an absolute URL.</p>

<p>In order to support media types such as JSON and XML, Spring WebFlux provides

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux provides an annotation-based programming model, where <code>@Controller</code> and

handle exceptions, and more. Annotated controllers have flexible method signatures and
do not have to extend base classes nor implement specific interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following listing shows a basic example:</p>

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can define controller beans by using a standard Spring bean definition.
The <code>@Controller</code> stereotype allows for auto-detection and is aligned with Spring general support

a web component.</p>

<p><code>@RestController</code> is a <a href="core.html#beans-meta-annotations">composed annotation</a> that is

<p>The <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotation is used to map requests to controllers methods. It has

<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping-head-options">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>@GetMapping</code> and <code>@RequestMapping(method=HttpMethod.GET)</code> support HTTP HEAD
transparently for request mapping purposes. Controller methods need not change.
A response wrapper, applied in the <code>HttpHandler</code> server adapter, ensures a <code>Content-Length</code>
header is set to the number of bytes written without actually writing to the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, HTTP OPTIONS is handled by setting the <code>Allow</code> response header to the list of HTTP
methods listed in all <code>@RequestMapping</code> methods with matching URL patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a <code>@RequestMapping</code> without HTTP method declarations, the <code>Allow</code> header is set to
<code>GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS</code>. Controller methods should always declare the
supported HTTP methods (for example, by using the HTTP method specific variants&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code>@GetMapping</code>, <code>@PostMapping</code>, and others).</p>
</div>

is not necessary in the common case.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping-composed">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux supports the use of <a href="core.html#beans-meta-annotations">composed annotations</a>
for request mapping. Those are annotations that are themselves meta-annotated with
<code>@RequestMapping</code> and composed to redeclare a subset (or all) of the <code>@RequestMapping</code>
attributes with a narrower, more specific purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>@GetMapping</code>, <code>@PostMapping</code>, <code>@PutMapping</code>, <code>@DeleteMapping</code>, and <code>@PatchMapping</code> are
examples of composed annotations. They are provided, because, arguably, most
controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method versus using <code>@RequestMapping</code>,
which, by default, matches to all HTTP methods. If you need an example of composed
annotations, look at how those are declared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux also supports custom request mapping attributes with custom request matching
logic. This is a more advanced option that requires sub-classing
<code>RequestMappingHandlerMapping</code> and overriding the <code>getCustomMethodCondition</code> method, where
you can check the custom attribute and return your own <code>RequestCondition</code>.</p>

<h5 id="webflux-ann-typeconversion"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-ann-typeconversion"></a>Type Conversion</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#mvc-ann-typeconversion">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some annotated controller method arguments that represent String-based request input (for example,
<code>@RequestParam</code>, <code>@RequestHeader</code>, <code>@PathVariable</code>, <code>@MatrixVariable</code>, and <code>@CookieValue</code>)
can require type conversion if the argument is declared as something other than <code>String</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For such cases, type conversion is automatically applied based on the configured converters.
By default, simple types (such as <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>Date</code>, and others) are supported. Type conversion
can be customized through a <code>WebDataBinder</code> (see <a href="#webflux-ann-initbinder"><code>DataBinder</code></a>) or by registering
<code>Formatters</code> with the <code>FormattingConversionService</code> (see <a href="core.html#format">Spring Field Formatting</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A practical issue in type conversion is the treatment of an empty String source value.
Such a value is treated as missing if it becomes <code>null</code> as a result of type conversion.
This can be the case for <code>Long</code>, <code>UUID</code>, and other target types. If you want to allow <code>null</code>
to be injected, either use the <code>required</code> flag on the argument annotation, or declare the
argument as <code>@Nullable</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#mvc-ann-matrix-variables">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3">RFC 3986</a> discusses name-value pairs in
path segments. In Spring WebFlux, we refer to those as &#8220;matrix variables&#8221; based on an
<a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html">&#8220;old post&#8221;</a> by Tim Berners-Lee, but they
can be also be referred to as URI path parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Matrix variables can appear in any path segment, with each variable separated by a semicolon and
multiple values separated by commas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, <code>"/cars;color=red,green;year=2012"</code>. Multiple
values can also be specified through repeated variable names&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example,
<code>"color=red;color=green;color=blue"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike Spring MVC, in WebFlux, the presence or absence of matrix variables in a URL does
not affect request mappings. In other words, you are not required to use a URI variable
to mask variable content. That said, if you want to access matrix variables from a
controller method, you need to add a URI variable to the path segment where matrix
variables are expected. The following example shows how to do so:</p>

    // q == 11
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Spring WebFlux, unlike Spring MVC, supports reactive types in the model&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example,
<code>Mono&lt;Account&gt;</code> or <code>io.reactivex.Single&lt;Account&gt;</code>. You can declare a <code>@ModelAttribute</code> argument
with or without a reactive type wrapper, and it will be resolved accordingly,
to the actual value if necessary. However, note that, to use a <code>BindingResult</code>
argument, you must declare the <code>@ModelAttribute</code> argument before it without a reactive
type wrapper, as shown earlier. Alternatively, you can handle any errors through the
reactive type, as the following example shows:</p>

<p>You can use the <code>@ResponseBody</code> annotation on a method to have the return serialized

<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>@ResponseBody</code> is also supported at the class level, in which case it is inherited by
all controller methods. This is the effect of <code>@RestController</code>, which is nothing more
than a meta-annotation marked with <code>@Controller</code> and <code>@ResponseBody</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>@ResponseBody</code> supports reactive types, which means you can return Reactor or RxJava
types and have the asynchronous values they produce rendered to the response.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>WebFlux supports using a single value <a href="#webflux-reactive-libraries">reactive type</a> to
produce the <code>ResponseEntity</code> asynchronously, and/or single and multi-value reactive types

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ResponseEntity&lt;Mono&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>ResponseEntity&lt;Flux&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> make the response status and

Use <code>Mono</code> if the body consists of 0..1 values or <code>Flux</code> if it can produce multiple values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Mono&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> provides all three&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;response status, headers, and body,
asynchronously at a later point. This allows the response status and headers to vary

<li>
<p><code>Mono&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;Mono&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>Mono&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;Flux&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> are yet another

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, the <code>@ExceptionHandler</code>, <code>@InitBinder</code>, and <code>@ModelAttribute</code> methods apply
within the <code>@Controller</code> class (or class hierarchy) in which they are declared. If you
want such methods to apply more globally (across controllers), you can declare them in a
class annotated with <code>@ControllerAdvice</code> or <code>@RestControllerAdvice</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>@ControllerAdvice</code> is annotated with <code>@Component</code>, which means that such classes can be
registered as Spring beans through <a href="core.html#beans-java-instantiating-container-scan">component scanning</a>. <code>@RestControllerAdvice</code> is a composed annotation that is annotated
with both <code>@ControllerAdvice</code> and <code>@ResponseBody</code>, which essentially means
<code>@ExceptionHandler</code> methods are rendered to the response body through message conversion
(versus view resolution or template rendering).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On startup, the infrastructure classes for <code>@RequestMapping</code> and <code>@ExceptionHandler</code>
methods detect Spring beans annotated with <code>@ControllerAdvice</code> and then apply their
methods at runtime. Global <code>@ExceptionHandler</code> methods (from a <code>@ControllerAdvice</code>) are
applied <em>after</em> local ones (from the <code>@Controller</code>). By contrast, global <code>@ModelAttribute</code>
and <code>@InitBinder</code> methods are applied <em>before</em> local ones.</p>

<p>By default, <code>@ControllerAdvice</code> methods apply to every request (that is, all controllers),

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux includes WebFlux.fn, a lightweight functional programming model in which functions
are used to route and handle requests and contracts are designed for immutability.
It is an alternative to the annotation-based programming model but otherwise runs on
the same <a href="#webflux-reactive-spring-web">Reactive Core</a> foundation.</p>

<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#webmvc-fn-overview">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In WebFlux.fn, an HTTP request is handled with a <code>HandlerFunction</code>: a function that takes
<code>ServerRequest</code> and returns a delayed <code>ServerResponse</code> (i.e. <code>Mono&lt;ServerResponse&gt;</code>).
Both the request and the response object have immutable contracts that offer JDK 8-friendly
access to the HTTP request and response.
<code>HandlerFunction</code> is the equivalent of the body of a <code>@RequestMapping</code> method in the
annotation-based programming model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incoming requests are routed to a handler function with a <code>RouterFunction</code>: a function that
takes <code>ServerRequest</code> and returns a delayed <code>HandlerFunction</code> (i.e. <code>Mono&lt;HandlerFunction&gt;</code>).
When the router function matches, a handler function is returned; otherwise an empty Mono.
<code>RouterFunction</code> is the equivalent of a <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotation, but with the major
difference that router functions provide not just data, but also behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>RouterFunctions.route()</code> provides a router builder that facilitates the creation of routers,
as the following example shows:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Router functions are used to route the requests to the corresponding <code>HandlerFunction</code>.
Typically, you do not write router functions yourself, but rather use a method on the
<code>RouterFunctions</code> utility class to create one.
<code>RouterFunctions.route()</code> (no parameters) provides you with a fluent builder for creating a router
function, whereas <code>RouterFunctions.route(RequestPredicate, HandlerFunction)</code> offers a direct way
to create a router.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, it is recommended to use the <code>route()</code> builder, as it provides
convenient short-cuts for typical mapping scenarios without requiring hard-to-discover
static imports.
For instance, the router function builder offers the method <code>GET(String, HandlerFunction)</code> to create a mapping for GET requests; and <code>POST(String, HandlerFunction)</code> for POSTs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides HTTP method-based mapping, the route builder offers a way to introduce additional
predicates when mapping to requests.
For each HTTP method there is an overloaded variant that takes a <code>RequestPredicate</code> as a
parameter, though which additional constraints can be expressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="webflux-fn-predicates"><a class="anchor" href="#webflux-fn-predicates"></a>Predicates</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can write your own <code>RequestPredicate</code>, but the <code>RequestPredicates</code> utility class
offers commonly used implementations, based on the request path, HTTP method, content-type,
and so on.

The example shown above also uses two request predicates, as the builder uses
<code>RequestPredicates.GET</code> internally, and composes that with the <code>accept</code> predicate.</p>

<p>Router functions are evaluated in order: if the first route does not match, the
second is evaluated, and so on.
Therefore, it makes sense to declare more specific routes before general ones.
This is also important when registering router functions as Spring beans, as will
be described later.
Note that this behavior is different from the annotation-based programming model, where the
"most specific" controller method is picked automatically.</p>

<p>When using the router function builder, all defined routes are composed into one

<p>It is common for a group of router functions to have a shared predicate, for instance a
shared path. In the example above, the shared predicate would be a path predicate that
matches <code>/person</code>, used by three of the routes. When using annotations, you would remove
this duplication by using a type-level <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotation that maps to
<code>/person</code>. In WebFlux.fn, path predicates can be shared through the <code>path</code> method on the
router function builder. For instance, the last few lines of the example above can be

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you run a router function in an HTTP server? A simple option is to convert a router
function to an <code>HttpHandler</code> by using one of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(RouterFunction)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(RouterFunction, HandlerStrategies)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can then use the returned <code>HttpHandler</code> with a number of server adapters by following
<a href="#webflux-httphandler">HttpHandler</a> for server-specific instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A more typical option, also used by Spring Boot, is to run with a
<a href="#webflux-dispatcher-handler"><code>DispatcherHandler</code></a>-based setup through the
<a href="#webflux-config">WebFlux Config</a>, which uses Spring configuration to declare the
components required to process requests. The WebFlux Java configuration declares the following
infrastructure components to support functional endpoints:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>RouterFunctionMapping</code>: Detects one or more <code>RouterFunction&lt;?&gt;</code> beans in the Spring
configuration, <a href="core.html#beans-factory-ordered">orders them</a>, combines them through
<code>RouterFunction.andOther</code>, and routes requests to the resulting composed <code>RouterFunction</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>HandlerFunctionAdapter</code>: Simple adapter that lets <code>DispatcherHandler</code> invoke
a <code>HandlerFunction</code> that was mapped to a request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ServerResponseResultHandler</code>: Handles the result from the invocation of a
<code>HandlerFunction</code> by invoking the <code>writeTo</code> method of the <code>ServerResponse</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The preceding components let functional endpoints fit within the <code>DispatcherHandler</code> request
processing lifecycle and also (potentially) run side by side with annotated controllers, if
any are declared. It is also how functional endpoints are enabled by the Spring Boot WebFlux
starter.</p>

With annotations, you can achieve similar functionality by using <code>@ControllerAdvice</code>, a <code>ServletFilter</code>, or both.

<p><a href="#web-uricomponents"><code>UriComponentsBuilder</code></a> implements <code>UriBuilder</code>. You can create a
<code>UriBuilder</code>, in turn, with a <code>UriBuilderFactory</code>. Together, <code>UriBuilderFactory</code> and

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most cases, the first option is likely to give the expected result, because it treats URI
variables as opaque data to be fully encoded, while the second option is useful if URI
variables do intentionally contain reserved characters. The second option is also useful
when not expanding URI variables at all since that will also encode anything that
incidentally looks like a URI variable.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>The CORS specification distinguishes between preflight, simple, and actual requests.
To learn how CORS works, you can read
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">this article</a>, among
many others, or see the specification for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring WebFlux <code>HandlerMapping</code> implementations provide built-in support for CORS. After successfully
mapping a request to a handler, a <code>HandlerMapping</code> checks the CORS configuration for the
given request and handler and takes further actions. Preflight requests are handled
directly, while simple and actual CORS requests are intercepted, validated, and have the
required CORS response headers set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to enable cross-origin requests (that is, the <code>Origin</code> header is present and
differs from the host of the request), you need to have some explicitly declared CORS
configuration. If no matching CORS configuration is found, preflight requests are
rejected. No CORS headers are added to the responses of simple and actual CORS requests
and, consequently, browsers reject them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each <code>HandlerMapping</code> can be
<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.9/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/handler/AbstractHandlerMapping.html#setCorsConfigurations-java.util.Map-">configured</a>
individually with URL pattern-based <code>CorsConfiguration</code> mappings. In most cases, applications
use the WebFlux Java configuration to declare such mappings, which results in a single,
global map passed to all <code>HandlerMapping</code> implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can combine global CORS configuration at the <code>HandlerMapping</code> level with more
fine-grained, handler-level CORS configuration. For example, annotated controllers can use
class- or method-level <code>@CrossOrigin</code> annotations (other handlers can implement
<code>CorsConfigurationSource</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rules for combining global and local configuration are generally additive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example,
all global and all local origins. For those attributes where only a single value can be
accepted, such as <code>allowCredentials</code> and <code>maxAge</code>, the local overrides the global value. See

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of view technologies in Spring WebFlux is pluggable. Whether you decide to
use Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, or some other view technology is primarily a matter of a
configuration change. This chapter covers the view technologies integrated with Spring
WebFlux. We assume you are already familiar with <a href="#webflux-viewresolution">View Resolution</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#mvc-view-thymeleaf">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine that emphasizes natural HTML
templates that can be previewed in a browser by double-clicking, which is very
helpful for independent work on UI templates (for example, by a designer) without the need for a
running server. Thymeleaf offers an extensive set of features, and it is actively developed
and maintained. For a more complete introduction, see the
<a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a> project home page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Thymeleaf integration with Spring WebFlux is managed by the Thymeleaf project. The
configuration involves a few bean declarations, such as
<code>SpringResourceTemplateResolver</code>, <code>SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine</code>, and
<code>ThymeleafReactiveViewResolver</code>. For more details, see
<a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html">Thymeleaf+Spring</a> and the WebFlux integration

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For <a href="#webflux-multiple-representations">Content Negotiation</a> purposes, it is useful to be able to alternate
between rendering a model with an HTML template or as other formats (such as JSON or XML),
depending on the content type requested by the client. To support doing so, Spring WebFlux
provides the <code>HttpMessageWriterView</code>, which you can use to plug in any of the available
<a href="#webflux-codecs">Codecs</a> from <code>spring-web</code>, such as <code>Jackson2JsonEncoder</code>, <code>Jackson2SmileEncoder</code>,
or <code>Jaxb2XmlEncoder</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike other view technologies, <code>HttpMessageWriterView</code> does not require a <code>ViewResolver</code>
but is instead <a href="#webflux-config-view-resolvers">configured</a> as a default view. You can
configure one or more such default views, wrapping different <code>HttpMessageWriter</code> instances
or <code>Encoder</code> instances. The one that matches the requested content type is used at runtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, a model contains multiple attributes. To determine which one to serialize,
you can configure <code>HttpMessageWriterView</code> with the name of the model attribute to use for
rendering. If the model contains only one attribute, that one is used.</p>

<p><span class="small"><a href="web.html#mvc-caching">Web MVC</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HTTP caching can significantly improve the performance of a web application. HTTP caching
revolves around the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header and subsequent conditional request
headers, such as <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>ETag</code>. <code>Cache-Control</code> advises private (for example, browser)
and public (for example, proxy) caches how to cache and re-use responses. An <code>ETag</code> header is used
to make a conditional request that may result in a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) without a body,
if the content has not changed. <code>ETag</code> can be seen as a more sophisticated successor to
the <code>Last-Modified</code> header.</p>

<p>Controllers can add explicit support for HTTP caching. We recommend doing so, since the

against conditional request headers. A controller can add an <code>ETag</code> and <code>Cache-Control</code>
settings to a <code>ResponseEntity</code>, as the following example shows:</p>

<p>You can use <code>ResourceUrlProvider</code> to rewrite URLs and apply the full chain of resolvers and
transformers (for example, to insert versions). The WebFlux configuration provides a <code>ResourceUrlProvider</code>
so that it can be injected into others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike Spring MVC, at present, in WebFlux, there is no way to transparently rewrite static
resource URLs, since there are no view technologies that can make use of a non-blocking chain
of resolvers and transformers. When serving only local resources, the workaround is to use
<code>ResourceUrlProvider</code> directly (for example, through a custom element) and block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that, when using both <code>EncodedResourceResolver</code> (for example, Gzip, Brotli encoded) and
<code>VersionedResourceResolver</code>, they must be registered in that order, to ensure content-based
versions are always computed reliably based on the unencoded file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.webjars.org/documentation">WebJars</a> are also supported through the
<code>WebJarsResourceResolver</code> which is automatically registered when the
<code>org.webjars:webjars-locator-core</code> library is present on the classpath. The resolver can
re-write URLs to include the version of the jar and can also match against incoming URLs
without versions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, from <code>/jquery/jquery.min.js</code> to

This is the recommended mode, since fixed, shared resources are preferred for event loop
concurrency. In this mode global resources remain active until the process exits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the server is timed with the process, there is typically no need for an explicit
shutdown. However, if the server can start or stop in-process (for example, a Spring MVC
application deployed as a WAR), you can declare a Spring-managed bean of type
<code>ReactorResourceFactory</code> with <code>globalResources=true</code> (the default) to ensure that the Reactor
Netty global resources are shut down when the Spring <code>ApplicationContext</code> is closed,
as the following example shows:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To send multipart data, you need to provide a <code>MultiValueMap&lt;String, ?&gt;</code> whose values are
either <code>Object</code> instances that represent part content or <code>HttpEntity</code> instances that represent the content and
headers for a part. <code>MultipartBodyBuilder</code> provides a convenient API to prepare a
multipart request. The following example shows how to create a <code>MultiValueMap&lt;String, ?&gt;</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock primary">

<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang="java" class="language-java hljs">MultipartBodyBuilder builder = new MultipartBodyBuilder();
builder.part("fieldPart", "fieldValue");
builder.part("filePart1", new FileSystemResource("...logo.png"));
builder.part("jsonPart", new Person("Jason"));
builder.part("myPart", part); // Part from a server request

MultiValueMap&lt;String, HttpEntity&lt;?&gt;&gt; parts = builder.build();</code></pre>

    part("jsonPart", new Person("Jason"))
    part("myPart", part) // Part from a server request
}

val parts = builder.build()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, you do not have to specify the <code>Content-Type</code> for each part. The content
type is determined automatically based on the <code>HttpMessageWriter</code> chosen to serialize it
or, in the case of a <code>Resource</code>, based on the file extension. If necessary, you can
explicitly provide the <code>MediaType</code> to use for each part through one of the overloaded
builder <code>part</code> methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a <code>MultiValueMap</code> is prepared, the easiest way to pass it to the <code>WebClient</code> is
through the <code>body</code> method, as the following example shows:</p>

<p>If the <code>MultiValueMap</code> contains at least one non-<code>String</code> value, which could also
represent regular form data (that is, <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>), you need not

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WebSocket protocol, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>, provides a standardized
way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server
over a single TCP connection. It is a different TCP protocol from HTTP but is designed to
work over HTTP, using ports 80 and 443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A WebSocket interaction begins with an HTTP request that uses the HTTP <code>Upgrade</code> header
to upgrade or, in this case, to switch to the WebSocket protocol. The following example
shows such an interaction:</p>

<h4 id="websocket-intro-architecture"><a class="anchor" href="#websocket-intro-architecture"></a>3.1.1. HTTP Versus WebSocket</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though WebSocket is designed to be HTTP-compatible and starts with an HTTP request,
it is important to understand that the two protocols lead to very different
architectures and application programming models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In HTTP and REST, an application is modeled as many URLs. To interact with the application,
clients access those URLs, request-response style. Servers route requests to the
appropriate handler based on the HTTP URL, method, and headers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, in WebSockets, there is usually only one URL for the initial connect.
Subsequently, all application messages flow on that same TCP connection. This points to
an entirely different asynchronous, event-driven, messaging architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WebSocket is also a low-level transport protocol, which, unlike HTTP, does not prescribe
any semantics to the content of messages. That means that there is no way to route or process
a message unless the client and the server agree on message semantics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WebSocket clients and servers can negotiate the use of a higher-level, messaging protocol
(for example, STOMP), through the <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</code> header on the HTTP handshake request.
In the absence of that, they need to come up with their own conventions.</p>

<h4 id="websocket-intro-when-to-use"><a class="anchor" href="#websocket-intro-when-to-use"></a>3.1.2. When to Use WebSockets</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WebSockets can make a web page be dynamic and interactive. However, in many cases,
a combination of Ajax and HTTP streaming or long polling can provide a simple and
effective solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, news, mail, and social feeds need to update dynamically, but it may be
perfectly okay to do so every few minutes. Collaboration, games, and financial apps, on
the other hand, need to be much closer to real-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Latency alone is not a deciding factor. If the volume of messages is relatively low (for example,
monitoring network failures) HTTP streaming or polling can provide an effective solution.
It is the combination of low latency, high frequency, and high volume that make the best
case for the use of WebSocket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind also that over the Internet, restrictive proxies that are outside of your control
may preclude WebSocket interactions, either because they are not configured to pass on the
<code>Upgrade</code> header or because they close long-lived connections that appear idle. This
means that the use of WebSocket for internal applications within the firewall is a more
straightforward decision than it is for public facing applications.</p>

<p>The <code>handle</code> method of <code>WebSocketHandler</code> takes <code>WebSocketSession</code> and returns <code>Mono&lt;Void&gt;</code>

through two streams, one for inbound and one for outbound messages. The following table
describes the two methods that handle the streams:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>WebSocketHandler</code> must compose the inbound and outbound streams into a unified flow and
return a <code>Mono&lt;Void&gt;</code> that reflects the completion of that flow. Depending on application
requirements, the unified flow completes when:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Either the inbound or the outbound message stream completes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inbound stream completes (that is, the connection closed), while the outbound stream is infinite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a chosen point, through the <code>close</code> method of <code>WebSocketSession</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When inbound and outbound message streams are composed together, there is no need to
check if the connection is open, since Reactive Streams signals end activity.

receives a cancellation signal.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rsocket-overview"><a class="anchor" href="#rsocket-overview"></a>5.1. Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSocket is an application protocol for multiplexed, duplex communication over TCP,
WebSocket, and other byte stream transports, using one of the following interaction
models:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Request-Response</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;send one message and receive one back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Request-Stream</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;send one message and receive a stream of messages back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Channel</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;send streams of messages in both directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Fire-and-Forget</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;send a one-way message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the initial connection is made, the "client" vs "server" distinction is lost as
both sides become symmetrical and each side can initiate one of the above interactions.
This is why in the protocol calls the participating sides "requester" and "responder"
while the above interactions are called "request streams" or simply "requests".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the key features and benefits of the RSocket protocol:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> semantics across network boundary&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for streaming requests such as <code>Request-Stream</code> and <code>Channel</code>, back pressure signals
travel between requester and responder, allowing a requester to slow down a responder at
the source, hence reducing reliance on network layer congestion control, and the need
for buffering at the network level or at any level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request throttling&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this feature is named "Leasing" after the <code>LEASE</code> frame that
can be sent from each end to limit the total number of requests allowed by other end
for a given time. Leases are renewed periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Session resumption&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is designed for loss of connectivity and requires some state
to be maintained. The state management is transparent for applications, and works well
in combination with back pressure which can stop a producer when possible and reduce
the amount of state required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fragmentation and re-assembly of large messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keepalive (heartbeats).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSocket has <a href="https://github.com/rsocket">implementations</a> in multiple languages. The
<a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">Java library</a> is built on <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty">Reactor Netty</a> for the transport. That means
signals from Reactive Streams Publishers in your application propagate transparently
through RSocket across the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="rsocket-protocol"><a class="anchor" href="#rsocket-protocol"></a>5.1.1. The Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the benefits of RSocket is that it has well defined behavior on the wire and an
easy to read <a href="https://rsocket.io/docs/Protocol">specification</a> along with some protocol
<a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket/tree/master/Extensions">extensions</a>. Therefore it is
a good idea to read the spec, independent of language implementations and higher level
framework APIs. This section provides a succinct overview to establish some context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Connecting</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially a client connects to a server via some low level streaming transport such
as TCP or WebSocket and sends a <code>SETUP</code> frame to the server to set parameters for the
connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The server may reject the <code>SETUP</code> frame, but generally after it is sent (for the client)
and received (for the server), both sides can begin to make requests, unless <code>SETUP</code>
indicates use of leasing semantics to limit the number of requests, in which case
both sides must wait for a <code>LEASE</code> frame from the other end to permit making requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Making Requests</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a connection is established, both sides may initiate a request through one of the
frames <code>REQUEST_RESPONSE</code>, <code>REQUEST_STREAM</code>, <code>REQUEST_CHANNEL</code>, or <code>REQUEST_FNF</code>. Each of
those frames carries one message from the requester to the responder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The responder may then return <code>PAYLOAD</code> frames with response messages, and in the case
of <code>REQUEST_CHANNEL</code> the requester may also send <code>PAYLOAD</code> frames with more request
messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a request involves a stream of messages such as <code>Request-Stream</code> and <code>Channel</code>,
the responder must respect demand signals from the requester. Demand is expressed as a
number of messages. Initial demand is specified in <code>REQUEST_STREAM</code> and
<code>REQUEST_CHANNEL</code> frames. Subsequent demand is signaled via <code>REQUEST_N</code> frames.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each side may also send metadata notifications, via the <code>METADATA_PUSH</code> frame, that do not
pertain to any individual request but rather to the connection as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Message Format</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RSocket messages contain data and metadata. Metadata can be used to send a route, a
security token, etc. Data and metadata can be formatted differently. Mime types for each
are declared in the <code>SETUP</code> frame and apply to all requests on a given connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While all messages can have metadata, typically metadata such as a route are per-request
and therefore only included in the first message on a request, i.e. with one of the frames
<code>REQUEST_RESPONSE</code>, <code>REQUEST_STREAM</code>, <code>REQUEST_CHANNEL</code>, or <code>REQUEST_FNF</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Protocol extensions define common metadata formats for use in applications:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket/blob/master/Extensions/CompositeMetadata.md">Composite Metadata</a>-- multiple,
independently formatted metadata entries.</p>

<h4 id="rsocket-java"><a class="anchor" href="#rsocket-java"></a>5.1.2. Java Implementation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">Java implementation</a> for RSocket is built on
<a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. The transports for  TCP and WebSocket are
built on <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty">Reactor Netty</a>. As a Reactive Streams
library, Reactor simplifies the job of implementing the protocol. For applications it is
a natural fit to use <code>Flux</code> and <code>Mono</code> with declarative operators and transparent back
pressure support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The API in RSocket Java is intentionally minimal and basic. It focuses on protocol
features and leaves the application programming model (e.g. RPC codegen vs other) as a
higher level, independent concern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main contract
<a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/blob/master/rsocket-core/src/main/java/io/rsocket/RSocket.java">io.rsocket.RSocket</a>
models the four request interaction types with <code>Mono</code> representing a promise for a
single message, <code>Flux</code> a stream of messages, and <code>io.rsocket.Payload</code> the actual
message with access to data and metadata as byte buffers. The <code>RSocket</code> contract is used
symmetrically. For requesting, the application is given an <code>RSocket</code> to perform
requests with. For responding, the application implements <code>RSocket</code> to handle requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not meant to be a thorough introduction. For the most part, Spring applications
will not have to use its API directly. However it may be important to see or experiment
with RSocket independent of Spring. The RSocket Java repository contains a number of
<a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/tree/master/rsocket-examples">sample apps</a> that
demonstrate its API and protocol features.</p>

<p>When configuring <code>MetadataExtractor</code> through <code>RSocketStrategies</code>, you can let

simply use a callback to customize registrations as follows:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>spring-webflux</code> depends on <code>reactor-core</code> and uses it internally to compose asynchronous
logic and to provide Reactive Streams support. Generally, WebFlux APIs return <code>Flux</code> or
<code>Mono</code> (since those are used internally) and leniently accept any Reactive Streams
<code>Publisher</code> implementation as input. The use of <code>Flux</code> versus <code>Mono</code> is important, because
it helps to express cardinality&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, whether a single or multiple asynchronous
values are expected, and that can be essential for making decisions (for example, when
encoding or decoding HTTP messages).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For annotated controllers, WebFlux transparently adapts to the reactive library chosen by
the application. This is done with the help of the
<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.9/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ReactiveAdapterRegistry.html"><code>ReactiveAdapterRegistry</code></a>, which
provides pluggable support for reactive library and other asynchronous types. The registry
has built-in support for RxJava 2/3, RxJava 1 (via RxJava Reactive Streams bridge), and
<code>CompletableFuture</code>, but you can register others, too.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For functional APIs (such as <a href="#webflux-fn">Functional Endpoints</a>, the <code>WebClient</code>, and others), the general rules
for WebFlux APIs apply&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code>Flux</code> and <code>Mono</code> as return values and a Reactive Streams
<code>Publisher</code> as input. When a <code>Publisher</code>, whether custom or from another reactive library,
is provided, it can be treated only as a stream with unknown semantics (0..N). If, however,
the semantics are known, you can wrap it with <code>Flux</code> or <code>Mono.from(Publisher)</code> instead
of passing the raw <code>Publisher</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, given a <code>Publisher</code> that is not a <code>Mono</code>, the Jackson JSON message writer
expects multiple values. If the media type implies an infinite stream (for example,
<code>application/json+stream</code>), values are written and flushed individually. Otherwise,
values are buffered into a list and rendered as a JSON array.</p>
